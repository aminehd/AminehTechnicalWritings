        "Previously we explained the concept of population and the concept of sample. Basically we have one population (e.g., population of American people) but we can sample a subset in many ways (e.g., sample of America people under age 18, sample of American people living in new your, etc).\n",

        "Now a statistic or measure can be defined on the whole population as well as any given sample. A statistic or a measure in mathematic is a generalization of concepts such as lenght or heigh for a given set. Since samples and the population are sets, we can define such things on them. A well known one is mean. Thus you can think of population mean or any given sample mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "So far it was fairly easy to explain things. But it gets a bit trickier when we wanna talk the distribution of such measures over allll samples and compare them with the value of measure on the poulation.\n",

        "The motivation behind sampling is that population is too big and it is virtually impossible to calculate the mean for the whole population. Let's say as a minister of something you need the average age of your population.  HERE!!!\n",
